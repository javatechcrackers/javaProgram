Iterator pattern is a commonly used design pattern in Java and .Net programming environment. This pattern is used to get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner without any need to know its underlying representation.
Iterator pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.
Implementation
We are going to create an Iterator interface which includes navigation method and a Container interface which returns the iterator. Concrete classes implementing the Container interface will be responsible to implement Iterator interface and use it.
IteratorPatternDemo, our demo class, will use NamesRepository, a concrete class implementation, to print Names stored as a collection in NamesRepository.
