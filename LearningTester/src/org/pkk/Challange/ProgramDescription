1.	Write a program that will analyse the string.... 

char str[90]="my brother is taller than me@1233334. I always a short man,but smart than him"; 

1)Remove spaces between words, 
2)Find the longest word in the String, 
3)Search and count the number of letters"e" in the string 4)Extact the number of integers in string 
5)Extract the number of doubles in string 
6)Extract the number of words in string 
7)Identify the number of sentences in the String.

2.	N players with weights are given as input. divide them into 2 teams with equal weights. while dividing , ensure that difference in number of players in each team is minimum. output the difference in number of players in 2 teams. 
input weights - 3 2 1 
output – 1

3.	a string contains oly 3 characters in a string -'a','b','c' . if in the string, 2 different chars occur together they are replaced with the third char. operation is repeated till no reduction is possible. the string must be evaluated from left to right always. 
input - abbc 
output- 1

For technical round they may ask to write 3 code in any language.
1.	Take a string by the user and ask the user to inter the another character and check whether it is palindrome or not.

Eg:-  enter any string: ab
	Enter a character and index at which u want to enter: a,2
	aba
	Yes, palindrome


2.	take a string by the user and split it as many ways as it possible.
Eg:- enter the string:- abcd
	a  bcd
	a  b  cd
	a  b  c  d
	abc   d
	ab  c d


3.	Finding the length between 2 integer in the string.

Eg:- enter no: 451276
Enter 2 integer:5 7
Length between 5 and 7: 3
